  #Inputs:  #abund = relative or raw abundance dataframe, with the samples as columns and OTUs as rows. Column names must correspond EXACTLY to sample names in metadata and row names must correspond EXACTLY to OTU names in taxonomy.
            
            #metadata = metadata dataframe, with samples as rows. Contents of dataframe may vary, but it MUST contain a column called "Sample_ID" that contains the sample names which will match exactly to the sample names in the abund dataframe.
  
            #taxonomy = taxonomy dataframe, with OTUs as rows. Contents of dataframe may vary,but it MUST contain a column called "OTUNumber" that contains the OTU names which will match exactly to the OTU names in the abund dataframe.

  df1$OTU=rep(rownames(abund),times=ncol(abund)) #add a new column, OTU, which contains the original OTU names ( rownames(abund) ), repeated by the number of columns ( times=ncol(abund) ). Because unlist will list values sequentially BY COLUMN, to create the "OTU" column the original OTU names in the original order are simply repeated X times, where X is the number of columns. This new column will have a length = nrow(abund) x ncol(abund), and now each value in the "abund" column has an associated value in the "OTU" column.
